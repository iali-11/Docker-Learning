# 🚀 Docker Learning – Multi-Container Flask Application

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey with Docker and Docker Compose, focused on building, containerising, and deploying a production-style multi-container Flask application.

The project demonstrates how to run a Flask web application backed by a Redis database, using Docker Compose for orchestration, persistent storage with volumes, environment variables for configuration, and NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer to support scaling.

## What This Project Covers

This project showcases core containerisation and DevOps concepts, including:
- Two routes to the application:
   -  / = displays a welcome message
   - /𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁 = increments and displays a visit count stored in Redis
- Docker fundamentals (images, containers, Dockerfiles)
- Multi-container applications with Docker Compose
- Service-to-service communication using Docker networking 
- Environment-based configuration using environment variables
- Persistent data storage using Docker volumes
- Reverse proxy and load balancing with NGINX
Horizontal scaling of services

## 📬 Final Notes
This repository is part of my ongoing learning in DevOps, Docker, and cloud-native application design. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
